what are algorithms that have both classification and regression implemntations?

for supervised:
	1. Decision tree
	2. Random forest
	3.Support vector machine
	4.Naive Bays Classifier
	5.K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

and all unsupervised: (such as)
	1. clustering,
 	2.dimension reduction (PCA, t-sne, autoencoder,...),
	3.missing value imputation,
	4.outlier detection,
