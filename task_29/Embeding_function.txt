what is embeding function (RNN & NLP)?


	In natural language processing (NLP), word embedding is a term used for the representation of words 
for text analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning 
of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning.
